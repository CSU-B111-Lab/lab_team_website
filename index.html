            <h3>Project Summary/Abstract</h3>
            <p>The ECE Student Projects Lab is a comprehensive effort to maintain, improve, 
                and ensure the safety of the electrical and computer engineering (ECE) student project spaces, including labs B111, B109, and the CreatorSpace. 
                Following a lithium-ion battery fire in B111 last semester, this project focuses on inspecting existing equipment to assess functionality, identifying and 
                replenishing missing or damaged tools, and refining safety protocols. The project also emphasizes maintaining and improving past systems, such as the RFID-based 
                laser cutter access system, to ensure the labs remain state-of-the-art and safe environments for student innovation. Equipment available for use includes: 3D printers, hand tools, power tools, soldering irons, 
                computers, oscilloscopes, variable power supplies, and much more!</p>

            <h3>Project Background</h3>
            <p>The ECE Student Projects Lab supports student-led engineering projects by providing access to specialized tools and equipment in the B111 and B109 labs,
                 as well as the CreatorSpace. However, due to the recent fire and normal wear and tear, the labs require a thorough inspection and overhaul. 
                 This includes ensuring that all equipment is safe, functional, and up-to-date, and that proper safety measures are in place. Additionally, past innovations 
                 like the RFID laser cutter access system require regular maintenance and upgrades to meet evolving needs.</p>

            <h3>Constraints and Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Safety Improvement: Address the lithium-ion battery fire incident by improving fire safety protocols, identifying potential hazards, and ensuring all equipment complies with safety standards.</li>
                <li>Equipment Inspection & Replacement: Audit all equipment in the labs for functionality, replacing or repairing damaged tools, and identifying missing items.</li>
                <li>System Upgrades: Maintain and improve on existing systems, including the RFID laser cutter access system, while identifying other areas for technological improvement.</li>
                <li>Budget & Resource Constraints: Achieve these goals while working within the budgetary and resource limits provided by the university.</li>
                <li>Collaboration & Sustainability: Foster a culture of collaboration within the labs while ensuring that all upgrades are sustainable for future use by students.</li>
            </ul>
