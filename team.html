                    <h4>Abdullah Althulyath</h4>
                    <p>I'm a senior at Colorado State University, pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering. Over the past few years, 
                        I've developed a strong passion for problem-solving, coding, and designing innovative systems. In my free time, 
                        I enjoy playing video games and hiking . Looking forward to applying my skills in the tech industry and continuing to learn and grow as an engineer.</p>

                    <h4>Matthew Lazo</h4>
                    <p>My name is Matthew Lazo, and I am currently a Senior here at CSU in Electrical Engineering. I have occupational interests working in 
                        aerospace defense and telecommunications. Originally from Oregon, I’ve lived in over 10 states across the U.S. and served 8 years in the U.S. Army. 
                        I was stationed mostly in Virginia and was deployed overseas twice. Outside of work, I enjoy mountain biking, playing video games, and jamming on the bass guitar.</p>
